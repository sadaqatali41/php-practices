// SOLID is a set of five design principles that developers use when creating object-oriented software.

// 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ==> A class should have only one reason to change, which means every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose.
// 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)           ==> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. (should be able to extends class behavior, without modifying it.) 
// 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)   ==> Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes. (ex. rectangle is parent class and square is child class).
// 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) ==> do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them.
// 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  ==> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
