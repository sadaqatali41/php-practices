// caching can help improve the performance of your application by storing frequently accessed data, 
// reducing the need to run expensive queries or processes repeatedly.

// ! Laravel supports several caching drivers, including:
// 1. File (default): Stores cache in the filesystem.
// 2. Database: Stores cache in a database table.
// 3. Redis: In-memory key-value store.
// 4. Memcached: Distributed memory caching system.
// 5. Array: Stores cache in the application's runtime (not persistent).
